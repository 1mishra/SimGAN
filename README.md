# SimGAN
Keras implementation of Apple's [Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.07828v1.pdf)

## Details
Implementation of `3.1 Appearance-based Gaze Estimation` on UnityEyes and MPIIGaze datasets as described in paper.

* Currently only Python 3 support.
* Tensorflow support and maybe PyTorch support in future.

## Implementation
This is meant to be a light-weight and clean implementation that is easy to understand - no deep shit. It can also be used as a resource to understand GANs in general and how they can be implemented.

## About waya.ai
Waya.ai is a company whose vision is a world where medical conditions are addressed early on, in their infancy. This approach will shift the health-care industry from a constant fire-fight against symptoms to a preventative approach where root causes are addressed and fixed. Our first step to make realize this vision is easy, accurate and available diagnosis. Please get in contact with me if this resonates with you!
